DS-3FeaturesClassification

# Build a classifier model using the given dataset to predict the target classes. 
This is a small and straightforward test developed by HIAE to check the basics of
machine learning.

Instructions
1. Choose your programming language of interest: R or Python;
2. Your results can be presented in any format. We suggest using a Jupyter
Notebook (for Python users) or RMarkDown (for R users);
3. Add comments to the main steps of your code (in English);
4. Consider that the results will be presented for a non-technical audience so
try to emphasize the results of your work in a clear manner.


- 1 Choose two different models of your choice to solve the problem;
- 2 Give a brief explanation of why you picked them;
- 3 Compare and argue over the results of the models.

# HOW TO RUN THIS PROJECT:
You can run this project on Google Colab, or run in your system.

In this notebook file you can run notebook_import_variables() to load all env variables, dataframes, scalers and another data, in any cell, to avoid re-run entire notebook to obtain data.
